# MusicianMIDI
Play live with Musician using a MIDI keyboard.

## Installation
This add-on requires the external **Bome MIDI Translator** software to convert incoming MIDI messages from your controller into keystrokes that can be captured by the add-on.

Install [Bome MIDI Translator Classic](https://www.bome.com/products/mtclassic) (Windows) or [Bome MIDI Translator Pro](https://www.bome.com/products/miditranslator) (Windows & macOS) then open the provided `Musician preset.bmtp` file.

The __Classic__ version is easy to use and works without paid license while the __Pro__ version is more complex and should be restarted every 20 minutes in trial mode. You can get a free license for any version if you [send a postcard to the developers](https://www.bome.com/postcardware).

## Configure MIDI input device
In Bome MIDI Translator __Classic__:
* Open the **Midi In** menu
* Select your MIDI input device

In Bome MIDI Translator __Pro__:
* Open the provided `Musician preset.bmtp` file
* Click on __Musician preset.bmtp__ on the left column
* Open the **MIDI** menu then click **Project Default MIDI Ports**
* Select your MIDI input device on the right column

## How to play
In WoW, click on the Musician minimap icon then **Open MIDI keyboard** or type `/mus midi`. You can play live using your MIDI keyboard as long as the MIDI keyboard window is focused in game.
